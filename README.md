# Api.ai - sample webhook implementation in Python

This is a really simple webhook implementation that gets Api.ai classification JSON (i.e. a JSON output of Api.ai /query endpoint) and returns a fulfillment response.

More info about Api.ai webhooks could be found here:
[Api.ai Webhook](https://docs.api.ai/docs/webhook)

# What does the service do?
It's the sample service i have created to get the status of Ticket Id. in which i have stored ticket id and status in Dictionary Format.

The service packs the result in the Api.ai webhook-compatible response JSON and returns it to Api.ai.
